Kubernetes is a docker container orchestration service, that is, it's a technology that allows maintenance to current servers and scaling them up as needed, such as when dealing with increased traffic.

Services like Youtube, Slack and Shopify are able to ensure that they're always available and functional no matter how much traffic they have to handle thanks to Kubernetes.

It's recommended when the product in question will have to constantly handle a large amount of users or when the traffic fluctuates depending on the time of day. That way it can always have the appropriate amount of servers up, and also save resources on periods of downtime.
