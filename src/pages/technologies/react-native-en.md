React native was created on an internal Facebook hackathon in 2013 and released for public use in 2015, and it keeps on growing.

It's biggest advantage over native development is the ability to reuse code from Android to iOS since it builds for both platforms given very simple adaptations, which buys a lot of time in development.

It's ecosystem is also a big selling point, with an active community that develops new packages and integrations day after day.
