Blockchain was born as a highly safe way for saving information through decentralization.

Bitcoin was what defined and utilized blockchain for the first time in 2008, looking to allow a direct transaction between two people, without the need for a middleman.

Since then many other technologies based on blockchain came to life, not only for money exchanges, but for smart contracts, intelectual property, asset tracking, distributed processing and continuous listings.

Blockchain is seen as something as revolutionary as the creation of the internet.
