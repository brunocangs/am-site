Heroku is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allows for easily making systems available on the web without having to worry about infrastructure or setting up and running a server. That way one can save time and resources since there's no need to worry about maintaining any of the services personally and it's guaranteed to be always online.

Aside from the ease of use, Heroku is scalable. It's able to adjust to a higher demand by automatically replicating and balancing the work between it's nodes and instances.
