Firebase was born as a tool for serverless development with a focus on it's realtime database. With it it's possible to have an online data store, without the need of a "always online" server, with added synchronizing and offline resources.



After being acquired by Google, Firebase gained several extra services such as notifications, noSQL database, performance, analytics and testing tools, cloud functions and more.



Today it's a complete solution with a 'pay as you go' plan, that means that the more you use, the more you pay and vice-versa.
