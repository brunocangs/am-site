CircleCI is a tool focused in continuous integration, helping in rapidly turning a newly developed piece of code into an update for an online product.

In the process of Continuous Integration (CI) one can setup automated test, image building, as well as deploying a whole the system itself, without the need of a human interacting with it.

CircleCI offers a friendly and flexible interface to help you implement such processes.
