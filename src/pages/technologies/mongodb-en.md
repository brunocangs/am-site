MongoDB is a document based data store with a focus on storing JSON data.

It gained visibility through a moment where alternatives to SQL were being sought after, and gained adoption in important products and companies.

Programming-wise it makes storing data in any shape simpler and optimizes the access to the information.

It's not meant to take over SQL, necessarily, but being used alongside it can result in a high performance product.
