## About

MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. We believe this is the most natural way to think about data, and is much more expressive and powerful than the traditional row/column model.

## Rich JSON Documents

- The most natural and productive way to work with data.
- Supports arrays and nested objects as values.
- Allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.
