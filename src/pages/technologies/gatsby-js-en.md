Gatsby.js is an open source framework that makes use of Node and React to build blazing fast web-based pages and systems.

After receiving some large funding, it caught the world's attention to how it solves the perfomance issue on the web.

In general terms, it obtains data from several sources as informed by the developer, persists it into a data layer which then gets used to hydrate and build the pages to be static, making their load times extremely quick.

Without a hit to performance it allows integrating with several data sources such as a CMS, Markdown files, APIs and even more complex implementations.

Another advantage is needing only server to serve the files it outputs and nothing as robust or as complex as, for example, a PHP application. Since all the processing work is done in the build phase, the browser doesn't need to assemble the page through React as is usual for PWAs.
