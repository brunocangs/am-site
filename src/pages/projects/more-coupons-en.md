'[Mais Vale](https://maisvale.appmasters.io)' (More Coupons) is an application that offers users discounts on various establishments, whether for consuming products and services from companies, loyalty programs, or prizes through raffles.

For the affiliated companies the advantage is to bring more new customers, attracting them through promotions and other advantages like customer loyalty. For the users the application offers a consistent way to save money and get to know new establishments from various segments.
    
> "From the get-go the attention given to the project by the App Masters team gave us the confidence we needed to get 'Mais Vale' off the ground. We've had and are continuing to have an excellent experience and can say without a doubt that the technical expertise, unmatched support and attention to detail are the company's differentials." - Bernardo Almeida, Mais Vale

Through the application the user "downloads" a discount coupon. It is validated via QRCode at the time of purchase, thus validating the use.

In addition to the discount on consuming products and services, the application allows the company to implement customer loyalty. In each purchase the customer earns points, which after reaching a certain amount, can be exchanged for other products.

The raffle feature was also a way to attract more users by offering the possibility to sign up to gain advantages with periodic raffles.


## Technology

We developed the system using React Native on Android and iOS versions, which are currently in internal beta in both stores.

For the backend we use PHP with the Lumen framework, MySQL database, and is being served through Heroku.

We use Firebase for the administrative area and also to send notifications to users.
