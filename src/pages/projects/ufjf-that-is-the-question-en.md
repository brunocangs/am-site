A very interesting app we have developed is the game That’s the Question. It  elaborated side by side with UFJF and was funded by the state of Minas Gerais Research Support Foundation (FAPEMIG). The constant interaction with the client has allowed a result beyond expectations for both the university and the users.

The two main objectives of the project are as follows: present to high school students the scientific projects under development at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de fora), and function as a “vocational test”. it helps in the perception of areas of interest and facilitating the identification of courses where there may be more affinity.

Aimed at high school students, the game creates a playful environment. The player takes the ENEM, enters the university, learns more about the courses, develops their knowledge, graduates and even masters at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora). All this through fun and interactive question and answer missions, where the student learns by having fun.

The game developed by us also has a scoring system, which ranks players in a ranking system to know who is the best student. It has both the "general ranking" and by school, creating a healthy competition. In addition, each player has his or her profile, where they can check the rank, medals won, missions completed, and the level of success in each area of knowledge. This makes it easy to choose a course when they actually enter college.
    
## Development

Since the game's conception, our team has always been in contact with the project managers at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora). Throughout the process, they were experimenting with each version, validating interactions and suggesting improvements to the app.
> “I attribute the success of this project to the quality of the team, the hard work, patience and persistence of everyone involved. The constant dialogue between the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora) team and the programmers was fundamental for us to reach the desired result ” - Bárbara Duque, Coordinator of Scientific Dissemination of the Institutional Image of Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora). 

This is how, with a lot of sharing ideas, we like to work. After all, here at App Masters we believe that only then will everything go as expected, and the app can be a real success, reaching all goals set, achieving the customer's goals and surprising the target audience.

## Reception

The app has been downloaded approximately a thousand times in a few weeks and has an average of 4.6 stars on the Google Play site, plus users using the web app, which requires no installation.

The student Andressa Borges uses the game and highlighted the look of the game. “It's very beautiful. I really liked the idea of the app and got interested just reading about on the University website! The fact that the game uses academic life as evolution is quite fun. I had a lot of fun and enjoyed learning some more fascinating facts!

It was time for the college entrance exam and the game distracted me, but giving me more incentive to focus! There is so much potential in the game! Congratulations!"she commented.

While the student Gabriel Henrique highlighted the area of student performance. “The app is very cool and interactive, the best part is the ranking, no doubt”.
    
## Technical details
