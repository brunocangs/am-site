A very interesting app we have developed is the game 'That’s the Question'. It was elaborated side by side with UFJF and funded by the state of Minas Gerais Research Support Foundation (FAPEMIG). The constant interaction with the client has allowed a result beyond expectations for both the university and the users.

The two main objectives of the project were to present to high school students the scientific projects under development at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora), and function as a “vocational test”. That way it helps in the finding areas of interest and finding the best matches for courses where there may be more affinity.

Aimed at high school students, the game creates a playful environment in which the player takes ENEM, Brazil's universal community college test, enters the university, learns more about the courses, develops their knowledge, graduates and even masters at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora). All this through fun and interactive missions, where the student learns by having fun.

The game developed by us also has a scoring system, which ranks players in a ranking system to know who is the best student. It's both ranked in general and by school, creating a healthy competition. In addition, each player has their profile, where they can check the rank, medals won, missions completed, and the level of success in each area of knowledge. This makes it easy to choose a course when they actually enter college.
    
## Development

Since the game's conception, our team has always been in contact with the project managers at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora). Throughout the process, they were experimenting with each version, validating interactions and suggesting improvements to the app.

> “I attribute the success of this project to the quality of the team, the hard work, patience and persistence of everyone involved. The constant dialogue between the Federal University of Juiz de Fora's (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora) team and the programmers was fundamental for us to reach the desired result ” - Bárbara Duque, Coordinator of Scientific Dissemination of the Institutional Image of Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora). 

That is the way we like to work, sharing ideas to devise the best solution. With a focus on having everything go as expected, the app can be a real success, reach all goals that were set and achieve the customer's goals in surprising the target audience.

## Reception

The app has been downloaded approximately a thousand times in a few weeks and has an average of 4.6 stars on the Google Play site, as well as users using the web app, which requires no installation.

The student Andressa Borges uses the game and highlighted the look of the game. 

> “It's very beautiful. I really liked the idea of the app and got interested just reading about it on the University website! The fact that the game uses academic life for it's evolution is quite fun. I've had a lot of fun and enjoyed learning some more fascinating things! It was time for the college entrance exam and the game distracted me, but gave me more incentive to focus! There is so much potential in the game! Congratulations!", she commented.

Meanwhile the student Gabriel Henrique highlighted the area of student performance. 

> “The app is very cool and interactive, the best part is the ranking, no doubt.”
    
## Technical details

The game was developed as a web app with React, to be used on mobile phones without the need for installation. That way even those using simpler phones and from any school can have fun with the app. In addition, a hybrid Android app was created for those who prefer to install the application.

The API was developed with Node and MongoDB and is hosted on Heroku. The “admin area” was implemented with React and is hosted on firebase.
