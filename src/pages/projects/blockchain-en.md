Blockchain has come to change the way transactions happen by making information public, and at the same time safer. We developed for Antonio Hoffert, economist and blockchain expert, a proof of concept using blockchain through the Ethereum network.

> “App Masters was of fundamental importance in the technical preparation of a proof of concept in Distributed Payment Reconciliation based on Blockchain technology. They were excellent professionals and easy to work with” - Antonio

According to the confidentiality agreement we cannot provide further details about the project. 

For the visual interface React was used, as it allows a quick and practical implementation of the solution, and for interaction with Ethereum we used web3.js.
