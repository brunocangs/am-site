App for people that, when in events or certain situations, need to make a quick introduction.

We created this simple app to train a new employee and decided to make it public.

In events people might need to send an introductory message. For that, with only the other person's phone number you can send them one of many preset messages with no need to add or save the phone into your contacts.

Those messages can be defined by the user and reused at any point in time.
