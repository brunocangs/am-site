To facilitate the hiring of a driver, who instead of meeting you in his car (such as Uber), meets you in your own car. Whether it's taking you to the airport, on a long trip, or just any event where you want to drink and come home worry free.
That is the premise of the service offered by Only Drivers, the "Chauffeur of the Hour”, to offer several highly skilled drivers to drive your car.


The app was born from the customers’ search for convenience in hiring drivers, while being able schedule appointments in advance, knowing the driver that will serve you, as well as rating the received service.

## Technologies

We developed the project using React with Firebase, storing the data in Firestore and accessing it via GraphQL. We also use Firebase to send notifications among users.
In addition to publishing the Android app on Google Play, we made it available via web app, serving directly from Firebase hosting.
