Resellers of products such as herbalife and Hinode deal with many people, make dozens of contacts daily and eventually make it difficult to keep up with each of them.
   
Thinking about this demand introduced Go Diamond, an application to facilitate the management of these leads, from the first contact to the completion of the business. We then developed an MVP, which is available in stores.

Initially the user reports his or her monthly sales goals, conversion information (such as “I need to make 3 calls to get a visit”) and other metrics, in order to help the app track them throughout the month.

Once the lead is included in the app, it will keep track of contacts, meetings and presentations, keeping a detailed schedule of upcoming actions to be taken, always aiming to reach monthly sales goals.


## Service Subscription

Many applications have been converting their business model to subscription in order to earn more significant recurring revenue.

MVP was developed with subscription functionality, both in Android and iOS versions. The user can try the application for a few days before opting for subscription.


## Technology

We developed the project using React Native, with Node backend and PostgreSql database.
